_Weaponry is an Integrated Penetration Testing, Security Research and Security Process Management Environment developed on the top of xulrunner, python and several other related technologies. The purpose of the tool is to provide an easy to use lightweight system for running penetration tests and exploitation tasks, do security research and manage complex security processes across systems and networks of any size._

Weaponry was never intended to be a replacement for the plethora of security testing and research tools already available. Weaponry is intended to only facilitate more complex and dynamic processes which have more than one outcome.

_Why yet another penetration testing tool?_ Here is a list of key differences between Weaponry and other available penetration testing tools.

  * Weaponry was never intended to be used as a replacement of your standard toolkit.
  * Weaponry only facilitates the process but never gets on its way.
  * Weaponry provides means for unhiding and aggregating important data which is often missed by other tools.
  * Weaponry is a tool which can be used to guide penetration testers to do a better job.
